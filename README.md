#### by The Pandas: Aaron Schneberger, Suha Khalil, Noelle Haviland

This study explores factors affecting the prices of used cars in the Indian automotive market using exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and interactive maps.

### File Descriptions
- maps: A folder containing videos of each of the three map visualizations so they can be viewed in environments that don't support the matplotlib backend.
- ne_110m_admin_0_countries: The 110m Natural Earth dataset, used in map_visualizations.ipynb to create interactive map plots.
- cities_geocoded_india.csv: CSV file containing latitude and longitude information for each of the thirteen cities in our dataset.
- data_cleaning_visualization- latest: The file containing our main exploratory data analysis, analyzing key features like brand, mileage, year of manufacturing, time, location, and price.
- map_visualizations: Interactive map visualizations exploring brand, sale price and fuel type by location.
- ml-final.yaml: A file you can use to install a virtual environment for the machine-learning notebook.
- ML: Uses several machine-learning algorithms (including MARS, KNN and linear GAM) to predict sale price using 24 of the 26 features in the dataset.
- Used_Car_Price_Prediction.csv: The used-car dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrajesh0sharma7/used-car-price-prediction)
